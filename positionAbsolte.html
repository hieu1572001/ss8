        survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
        into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the 
        release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
         passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
         software like Aldus PageMaker including versions 
         of Lorem Ipsum.
